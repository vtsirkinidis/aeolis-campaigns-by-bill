# The Cult of the Broken

### Introduction
The pristess always had the Queen's ear when insisting that the faith of Aeolis comes before other priorities. According to the priestess all families should contribute an able son to become a blood thrall. This has lead to a lot of the family households feeling a deep spite against the Temple and the Priestess. Trouble is already boiling and it only needs someone to rise to the occasion and trigger chaos.
